###### Write a Python program that can “make change.” Your program should take two numbers as input, one that is a monetary amount charged and the other that is a monetary amount given. It should then return the number of each kind of bill and coin to give back as change for the difference between the amount given and the amount charged. The values assigned to the bills and coins can be based on the monetary system of any current or former government. Try to design your program so that it returns as few bills and coins as possible.

```python
def change_calculator(actual, given):
	diff = given - actual
	if diff >= 500:
		print(f"{diff//500} 500 ruppee notes")
		diff -= (diff//500)*500
	if diff >= 200:
		print(f"{diff//200} 200 ruppee notes")
		diff -= (diff//200)*200
	if diff >= 100:
		print(f"{diff//100} 100 ruppee notes")
		diff -= (diff//100)*100
	if diff >= 50:
		print(f"{diff//50} 50 ruppee notes")
		diff -= (diff//50)*50
	if diff >= 20:
		print(f"{diff//20} 20 ruppee notes")
		diff -= (diff//20)*20
	if diff >= 10:
		print(f"{diff//10} 10 ruppee notes")
		diff -= (diff//10)*10
	if diff >= 5:
		print(f"{diff%5} 5 ruppee coins")
		diff -= (diff//5)*5
	if diff >= 2:
		print(f"{diff//2} 2 ruppee coins")
		diff -= (diff//2)*2
	if diff >= 1:
		print(f"{diff//1} 1 ruppee coins")
		diff -= (diff//1)*1

actual = int(input("Enter bill amount:"))
gievn = int(input("Enter given amount:"))	
change_calculator(actual, given)
```
